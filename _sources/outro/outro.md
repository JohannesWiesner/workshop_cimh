# Thanks for joining!

Here are some links that might be useful for you :)

## Neurostars

If you are working neuroimaging research, make sure to join the [neurostars](https://neurostars.org/) forum. It's a great place for Q&A in the neuroimaging world!

## Brainhack

Do you want to visit more workshops and learn from peers in a friendly environment? Then make sure to not miss out on upcoming [brainhacks](https://brainhack.org/)!

## Ubuntu-Image

Markus Dreier from research IT and Johannes Wiesner from the CSP-group have worked on an Ubuntu image over the last months. This image contains all the research software you need (so
you don't have to install everything from scratch) and saves you a lot of struggles that most people (especially in neuroimaging) research encounter on Windows. It's also possible to create
your own standard image for your working group, so new members automatically get all the software that your team uses. More information on that [here](http://wiki.zi.local/services/linuxclient)

## Create a standardized conda environment

In case you are using Python & R for your data analysis: The [TCY](https://github.com/JohannesWiesner/tcy) repo can help you with creating your personalized conda environment with all the packages that you need for your
research. All you need to do is to create a spreadsheet file with the packages you want and TCY will create a recipe for you to quickly set up your conda environment :)

## Create a docker image for your group

If you joined the containerization workshop, then check out [neurodocker](https://github.com/ReproNim/neurodocker). This project aims to provide an easier way to create personalized Docker containers.
The CSP-group is already using neurodocker behind the scenes in their [csp_docker](https://github.com/JohannesWiesner/csp_docker) repo.
