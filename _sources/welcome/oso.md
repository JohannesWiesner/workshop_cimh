# Open Science Office at ZI
## What is the Open Science Office?
CIMH has founded an Open Science Office to coordinate all the great open and reproducible science efforts of the institute. The Office will initiate regular meetings of interested scientists to enhance interaction on this topic. It is integrated in ZIâ€™s Office for Research Strategy and Research Support. Melanie Fritz acts as a contact point for initiatives, the Office has been started following an initiative by Gordon Feld.
