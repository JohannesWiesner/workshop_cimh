# Early Career Researchers at CIMH

## Rocket Chat
Dear Early Career Researchers at CIMH,

There is a Rocket.Chat group for early career researchers at ZI (PhD students/early postdocs) to connect with peers and exchange experience/knowledge. To join, you can click [this link](https://chat.zi-mannheim.de/invite/mbZEaL). Rocket.Chat is an instant messenger hosted within ZI and is already used by many groups for team communication. Find more information in the intranet ZI wiki [here](http://wiki.zi.local/services/chat?s%5B%5D=rocket). After joining the group, we kindly ask you to introduce yourself (academic position/stage, working group, field of research) in one or two sentences in the #Introduction channel.

## Mailing list
We have also created a mailing list (cimh-ecrs@zi-mannheim.de) on top of our Rocket Chat group to be able to reach ECRs who are not regularly using Rocket Chat.

If you want to join, follow these steps:

1) Log in to Outlook with the [browser version of Outlook](https://owa.zi-mannheim.de/) (it works only with the browser option, not with the installed version).
2) Click on the gear icon in the upper right corner and select "Options".
3) A panel will appear on the left side. Click on the "General" ribbon and then on "Distribution lists".
4) Click on the little icon that shows two people  with a little plus symbol and search for “ZI_ECRS”, then click on “Join”
5) Wait for approval from one of the mailing list admins

You can of course always remove yourself from the mailing list if you don't want to receive mail anymore :)

## Meet Ups
We are trying to have regular meet ups every couple of months to get together in the evening. This is self-organized, i.e. everyone can suggest possible dates and/or events :) Join the Rocket.Chat group or the Mailing-List to stay updated!

Greetings,

Simon, Miruš, Johannes, Çağatay & Niclas
