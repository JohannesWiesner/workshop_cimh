# Early Career Researchers at CIMH
## Mailing List & Slack Group
### Mailing-List
Hi everyone,
first of all, as you might notice, we have created a mailing list (cimh-ecrs@zi-mannheim.de) on top of our Slack group to also be able to reach ECRs who are not regularly using Slack. Welcome!

The CIMH Early Career Researchers also have their own mailing list where we share information on upcoming events. If you want to join, follow these steps:

1) Log in to Outlook with the [browser version of Outlook](https://owa.zi-mannheim.de/) (it works only with the browser option, not with the installed version).
2) Click on the gear icon in the upper right corner and select "Options".
3) A panel will appear on the left side. Click on the "General" ribbon and then on "Distribution lists".
4) Click on the little icon that shows two people  with a little plus symbol and search for “ZI_ECRS”, then click on “Join”
5) Wait for approval from one of the mailing list admins

### Slack Group
Early Career Researchers Slack Group - inofficial
There is an inofficial and informal slack group for early career researchers at ZI (PhD students/early postdocs) to connect with peers and exchange experience/knowledge. To join, you can send an email to johannes.wiesner@zi-mannheim.de. When joining the Slack group, we kindly ask you to introduce yourself (academic position/stage, working group, field of research) in one or two sentences in the #intros channel.
